This is an Express App that can retrieve books, get information from an indvidual book, create books, delete books, or update books. Very straight forward.

Uses relational database ([SQLite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3)) to store book information and uses [Sequelize.js](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/) to communicate, model, and validate the database information.
